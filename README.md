# Instruction (Must Read)
# ***Most Important thing is we have to know the update of each other. And If we do not know about the update features of our website and try to push then must will be conflict in our code. So, if we want to avoid the conflict we must have to be active as well as inform our update after 30 minutes to each others in our group(CODE WITH HOPE).

#### If you are new first clone the repo please 'git clone https://github.com/Tawhidul3233/survey-bee-client.git'

#### You have to create a branch(we recommend by your name). run command ---> git checkout -b yourname

## Rules of pushing your code to github

# ***(Before your work make sure you are showing the update materials. If you do not showing the update materials of website, you have to inform the group CODE WITH HOPE).

### Before pushing your change to your branch ===> run this command | git checkout yourbranchname ---> git pull origin main (you have to get all materials that exist in our main repo)

### Then run | git checkout yourbranchname ---> To add a particular file, use the following command: $ git add path/to/file ---> git commit -m "your message" ---> git push origin yourbranchname
